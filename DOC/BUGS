Bugs and Known Problems
-----------------------

o a few keyboard-related bugs: e.g. pressing SHIFT+1 and then
  releasing SHIFT should still give '!' characters

o The cycle-exact ANTIC/GTIA/CPU timing is not 100%.
  This causes display bugs in following programs:
  - Surf's up (game) (the horizon)
  - Dimension X (game) (alignment problem)
  - Te.mod (demo) (small glitched pixel in the final credits on the bottom left)
  - Our 5oft Unity Part (demo) (cycle-alignment, probably WSYNC)
  - Isolation (demo) (vector animations)
  - 80 Random Moving Rectangles (demo) (top left of rectangles, screen data
         is modified while drawing a scanline)
 
o Non-bugs:
  - Ergo Bibamus (demo) (one pixel of the flower above the perspective scroll)
  - Mail Order Monsters (game)
	 (some colour changes do not align with text, occurs on a real Atari) 
  - The Break (demo) (bugs on the left side of photo)

o The following programs are improved by using the new cycle-exact code:
  - 8 Players Demo (demo)
  - Bewesoft's Demo (demo)
  - Bitter Reality (demo)
  - Demonic Laughter (music collection)
  - Extract (graphics collection)
  - GED (graphics editor)
  - Joyride (demo)
  - Mail Order Monsters (game)
  - Master of the Lamps (game)
  - Orneta '95 invitro (demo)
  - Our 5oft Unity Part (demo)
  - Studio Dream (demo)
  - Sweet Illusion (demo)
  - Te.mod (demo)
  - The Break (demo)
  - Miner 2049'er (game) (rotating 5's)
  - Dimension X (game) (title screen upper and lower bars) 
  - Graphics impossible (demo) (Antic magazine)
  - Power Graph (graphics editor)
  - Darkness Warrior (picture)

o POKEY interrupts are scanline-, not cycle-exact.
  This causes display or sound bugs in following programs:
  - Joyride (demo) (white lines on title picture)
  - Mirax Force (game) (speech)
  - Saturday Demo (demo) (music)
  - The Last Guardian (game) (speech)

o sound emulation uses VOL_ONLY hack.
  This causes sound bugs in following programs:
  - Digital Trash (demo)
  - Ghostbusters (game)
  - Overmind (demo)

o intensive 130xe-banks switching slows down emulation much.
  This causes performance problems in following programs:
  - Impossible but Real (demo)
  - Sheol (demo)
  - Total Daze (demo)
  - Ultra (demo)

o SDL port uses call back system for filling sound buffer.
  This causes wrong sound effects (noise) in some games.
