Bugs and Known Problems
-----------------------

o a few keyboard-related bugs: e.g. pressing SHIFT+1 and then
  releasing SHIFT should still give '!' characters

o The cycle-exact ANTIC/GTIA/CPU timing is not 100%.
  This causes display bugs in following programs:
  - Surf's up (game) (The horizon)
  - Dimension X (game) (aligment problem? not tested on acutal machine)
  - Te.mod (demo) (small glitched pixel in the final credits on the bottom left)
  - The break(demo) (bug may exist in the original, check)
  - Our 5oft Unity Part (demo) (cycle-aligment, probably WSYNC)

o Non-bugs:
  - Mail Order Monsters (game)
	 (some colour changes do not align with text, occurs on a real Atari) 

o The following programs are improved by using the new cycle-exact code
  - 8 Players Demo (demo)
  - Bewesoft's Demo (demo)
  - Bitter Reality (demo)
  - Demonic Laughter (music collection)
  - Extract (graphics collection)
  - GED (graphics editor)
  - Joyride (demo)
  - Mail Order Monsters (game)
  - Master of the Lamps (game)
  - Orneta '95 invitro (demo)
  - Our 5oft Unity Part (demo)
  - Studio Dream (demo)
  - Sweet Illusion (demo)
  - Te.mod (demo)
  - The Break (demo)
  - Miner 2049'er (game) (rotating 5's)
  - Dimension X (game) (title screen upper and lower bars) 
  - Graphics impossible (demo) (Antic magazine)
(not tested:)
  - Power Graph (graphics editor)
  - Darkness Warrior (picture)
o POKEY interrupts are scanline-, not cycle-exact.
  This causes sound bugs in following programs:
  - Mirax Force (game)
  - Saturday Demo (demo)
  - The Last Guardian (game)

o sound emulation is not enough accurate
  This causes sound bugs in following programs:
  - Numen (demo)

o sound emulation uses VOL_ONLY hack.
  This causes sound bugs in following programs:
  - Digital Trash (demo)
  - Ghostbusters (game)
  - Overmind (demo)

o intensive 130xe-banks switching slows down emulation much.
  This causes performance problems in following programs:
  - Impossible but Real (demo)
  - Sheol (demo)
  - Total Daze (demo)
  - Ultra (demo)

o SDL port uses call back system for filling sound buffer.
  This causes wrong sound effects (noise) in some games.
