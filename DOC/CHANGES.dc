30-Jan-2006	atari800dc v0.76

	* use Atari800 cvs code base as of jan-27-2006
	* use KOS svn code base version 289
	* unplugging/replugging controllers after atari800dc has started
	  up works now
	* screen update is now done by an assembler routine

17-Jan-2003	atari800dc v0.75

	* use Atari800 cvs code base as of jan-11-2003
	* reverted the sound changes which were introduced in the 0.72
	  version - the sound should be similar to 0.71.
	* saved states on the VMU now show a Atari icon. Due to a
	  change in the layout of the state save file, saved states of
	  previous versions aren't recognized.
	* changing video mode of emulated Atari now doesn't change the
          video mode used to drive the screen. These 2 video mode
          settings (what the emulated Atari thinks the video mode is,
          and the video mode used by the DC) can now be changed
          independently.
	  Setting them to different values will disable double
          buffering, so best results are achieved if both settings are
          the same.
	* buttons B, X, Y on the 1st DC controller can now be
          redefined to generate simulated key presses on the
          keyboard. If they are redefined, the Start, Select, and
          Option keys can be entered in the keyboard emulation
          screen.

21-Sep-2002	atari800dc v0.72

	* use Atari800 cvs code base as of sep-17-2002
	* changing CDs should now work more reliably
	* load and save (VMU) state now display "please wait" messages
	  and report if the save failed

21-Jul-2002	atari800dc v0.71

	* use Atari800 1.2.3 code base
	* support to save/restore status on VMU.
	  The status will be saved on the first VMU found, unless the
	  configuration file contains an entry for STATE_DIR which is
	  not empty and not ".".
	* changing video mode of emulated Atari (PAL/NTSC) now changes
	  the video refresh rate of the DC (50 for PAL/60 for
	  NTSC). Since the timing of atari800dc now depends on the
	  video refresh rate, the PAL/NTSC differences are better
	  emulated.
	* support for the Arcade Stick.
	* implemented double buffered screen update with the
	  possibility to switch at runtime between normal screen
	  update and double buffered version

17-May-2002	atari800dc v0.7

	* support for autostarting executable files or atr images:
	  place autorun.com or autorun.exe or autorun.atr into the
	  root directory of the CD
	  autorunning cartridges is not implemented (the emulator
	  needs the cart type, and there is no way to tell him
	  automatically)
	* selecting (inserting) a cartridge will now start it
	  immediately
	* 800: added keyboard emulation using DC controller: now most
	  keys can be generated with the standard DC controller
	* 5200: added keypad emulation (only for the 1st 5200
	  controller)
	* 800: Option/Select/Start are now emulated with the DC
	  keyboard (F2/F3/F4)
	* support to change video mode of emulated Atari (PAL/NTSC)

08-May-2002	atari800dc v0.65

	* directory browsing on the CD implemented. Due to additional
	  CD accesses needed for this, don't populate a directory with
	  more than a few hundred files, otherwise entering the
	  directory will become very slow.
	* after startup, the CD can be exchanged.

15-Apr-2002	atari800dc v0.61

	* fix display glitch on the left side introduced in the last
	  version
	* in the crash menu one item wasn't centered

11-Apr-2002	atari800dc v0.6

	* speed increase: use new DIRTYRECT facility of the a800 main
	  code
	* 5200: controller joystick now generates 5200 controller
	  compatible (analog) data.
	* 800: controller joystick also generates joystick direction
	  events (previously only the joypad did)
	* customized ui
	* support for ui switch "emulate paddle": must now be turned
	  on when using paddles. Up to four paddles are supported
	  (only 2 tested, don't have more controllers; makes sense in
	  800 mode only, 5200 results are undefined :-)
	* in ui, B button is now the same as R trigger (go back)

05-Apr-2002	atari800dc v0.5

	* sound fixed (reason of the large version jump)
	* improved ui "keyrepeat"
	* 800: simple paddle support
	* 5200: Y key now generates "H" - some games want a "H" to
	  start

27-Mar-2002	atari800dc v0.2

	* implemented "keyrepeat" while in the emulator ui (controller
	  only)
	* fixed crash when system was set to atari 800 (not XL) and
	  less than 3 controllers were connected
	* some sound changes (but they don't improve anything :-)
	* added support for 5200 controller 2nd action button

22-Mar-2002	atari800dc v0.1
