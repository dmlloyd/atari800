2002-08-07  Petr Stehlik  <pstehlik@sophics.cz>
* atari_sdl.c:
  - added atexit(SDL_Quit) to clean up after unsuccessful initialization.
  - fixed "-help" so that it doesn't initialize graphics mode. 
  - added "-sound" and "-nosound" support so you can disable sound if
    your sound card is not plugged in :)
  - added "-dsprate" support
  - added support for the configure option --disable-SOUND
  - added Aflushlog() to Atari_Exit() thus debug info is displayed now
  - when sound card init failed the application continues to run with sound
    disabled (previously it was exiting immediately)
* atari_sdl.c, atari_falcon.c, cassette.c, atari.c, atari_vga.c:
  fixed "-help" formatting

2002-07-24  Piotr Fusik  <fox@scene.pl>
* cartridge.[ch], ui.c, DOC/cart.txt, DOC/README: 256K and 512K XEGS carts
  (thanks to Nir Dary)

* pia.c: removed a hack that affected 1088 XE
* antic.c, memory-d.c, atari800.man: separate ANTIC access to extended memory
  for 130 XE and 320 Compy Shop
* DOC/README: updated features

** released as 1.2.3

2002-07-04  Vasyl Tsvirkunov  <vasyl@pacbell.net>
* ui.c,gtia.c,atari.h,cassette.h: cassette image loading is available from
  main menu. Also, main menu allows to persist "Hold Start" setting.
  Interlaced screenshot is commented out in main menu.
* ui_wince.c: updated to reflect above changes (one port-specific item was
  piggyback on interlaced screenshot, had to move).

2002-07-04  Piotr Fusik  <fox@scene.pl>
* atari.c, memory-d.c, ui.c: emulation of 16K RAM machines: 400 and 600XL
* cpu.c: cycle-exact LSR $D01A

* monitor.c: fixed optype6502[] to match unofficial instructions

2002-06-27   Petr Stehlik  <pstehlik@sophics.cz>
* atari_sdl.c: updated LPTjoy support to compile under Linux only. If there's
  another Unix flavor that can read parallel port using ioctl then it can be
  easily added. Just define LPTJOY for it (see the begining of atari_sdl.c).

2002-06-27  Piotr Wiszowaty  <pwiszowa@elka.pw.edu.pl>
* atari_sdl.c: added LPTjoy support for Linux

2002-06-23  Petr Stehlik  <pstehlik@sophics.cz>
* OK, the "-palette" patch from Andrew was completely wrong. I fixed it
  the right way and when I was at it I also moved the "-palette" command
  line option from main atari.c to colours.c.
* I also decided to fix the command line options in general, so I made some
  changes to atari.c and atari_x11.c.
* At last I corrected a bunch of things in atari_sdl.c so that now SDL port
  recognizes "-help". The other options now use single "-" to conform to
  the rest of Atari800 application.

2002-06-20  Petr Stehlik  <pstehlik@sophics.cz>
* atari.c: "unistd" header included - it should fix a start problem on FreeBSD
           4.5 according to an anonymous patch on sf.net.
* colours.c: loaded color palettes were ignored. Andrew Church posted a patch
             on sf.net that fixes it.
* atari800.man: manual page updated by Rob McMullen

2002-04-11  Piotr Fusik  <fox@scene.pl>
* pokey.c: allow high-speed disk i/o (Alpha-Load works)

2002-04-07  Christian Groessler <cpg@aladdin.de> and Petr Stehlik
* non-ANSI "t" parameter in fopen ("rt" and "wt" used for CR/LF files
  in DOS-like operating systems) removed since it was causing problems
  with KallistiOS Dreamcast library. Linux glibc could also be affected
  as it aborts scanning the mode parameter when it encounters an unknown
  char (consider "wt+"). Code was updated to take care of the possible
  extra \r before \n at end of fgets string. fputs() should be OK as
  the text mode is most probably the default mode.

2002-03-29  Vasyl Tsvirkunov <vasyl@pacbell.net>
* Dirty update scheme is completed

2002-03-18  Piotr Fusik  <fox@scene.pl>

  and blocked opposite joystick directions (good for "Mario Bros.")

  instructions

  removed enable_rom_patches, added: enable_h_patch, enable_p_patch and

  Device_EHOPEN, Device_EHREAD and Device_EHWRITE (now K: and E: handlers
  are implemented in the same way as H: and P:)

  supercart
* cartridge.h, cartridge.c: new module, for inserting cartridges (previously
  in memory-d) and bank-switching (previously in memory-d and supercart)

  removed cartridge types and Insert/Remove functions for cartridges
* rt-config.c: removed #define TRUE/FALSE and extern int Ram256 (it's in
  atari.h)
* memory-d.h, memory-d.c: rewritten to support the new cartridge module
* pia.c: Ram256 moved to atari.c (it's not related with PIA)
* gtia.h: declared TRIG and TRIG_latch (accessed by memory-d)
* pia.c, gtia.c: cartA0BF_enabled is used instead of rom_inserted
* ui.h: declared SelectCartType(), removed mach_xlxe and Ram256
  (which are declared in atari.h)
* atari.c: support for new rtime and cartridge modules
* ui.c: inserting, removing and converting of new cartridge types
* Makefile.in, common.mak: added cartridge and rtime, removed supercart
* supercart.c, supercart.h: removed - routines moved to new modules cartridge
  and rtime

* binload.c: 0x31 stored at 0x300 ("Studio Dream" loads now)
* supercart.c: added "byte &= 0x0f" to prevent out of bounds accesses
  to regset[]
* pokey.c: SKSTAT variable renamed to SKCTLS to avoid confusions
  (it's the write-only, not the read-only Pokey register)
* devices.c: replaced "dGetByte(0x2e)" with "regX" in H: handler routines
  (fixes problems with Atari BASIC's GET/PUT/INPUT/PRINT)
* cpu.c: on reset, the I flag is set (now reset works if stuck in interrupts)
* pia.c: & 0x3f on read PACTL and PBCTL (bits 6 and 7 are read-only in real
  PIA)
* antic.c: described cycle-exact Antic timing for a few modes
  (not implemented)
* devices.c: added open mode 9 (append) for H: device
* pokey.c: potentiometers emulation improved: POTGO and ALLPOT registers
  and bit 2 of SKCTLS implemented, "Tree Surgeon" no longer hangs
* pokey.c, pokey.h, pokeysnd.c, pokeysnd.h: moved a few definitions from
  pokeysnd to pokey (the goal is not to duplicate the variables of same
  meaning in pokey and pokeysnd, e.g. AUDC/AUDF/AUDCTL)
* pokey.c: blocked POTs, SERIN, SEROUT, KBCODE, IRQ, SKSTAT, SKCTLS
  in the second Pokey chip, second Pokey unaccesible until stereo_enabled set
  (helps some stereo detection routines)
* pokey.c, pokey.h, pokeysnd.c: replaced bit17[] with poly9_lookup[] and
  poly17_lookup[]. bit17[] was initialized with rand(), while poly9/17_lookups
  use the original POKEY algorithms. Moreover, poly9/17_lookups are smaller,
  which saves ca. 100 KB of memory.
* atari.h, pokey.h, antic.c, pokey.c: true RANDOM emulation (both 9- and
  17-bit poly) ! Not using rand() anymore. POKEY_Frame() and cpu_clock are
  needed for it. Try the "Bank Bang!" game.
* antic.c, gtia.c: the background color can be changed inside a scanline.
  Currently implemented only for blank lines without PMG.
  Try the "Partyland" part of the "Bitter Reality" demo.
  The feature can be disabled by defining NO_CYCLE_EXACT.
* pokey.c: STIMER fixed (speech in "Mirax Force" is better, but still
  not perfect)
* cpu.c: slight optimization of ROL and ROR
* cpu.c: Read-Modify-Write (RMW) instructions (ASL, INC, etc.) store
  the unmodified value of $D01A before they store the modified value.
  Now you can see the white dots made with INC $D01A.
* ui.h: removed declaration of atarixl_os (why was it declared here?)
