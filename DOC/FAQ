Frequently asked questions (with answers)
-----------------------------------------

0. Q: Where to get ROM files for the emulator?
   A: Download the xf25.zip from http://prdownloads.sf.net/atari800/xf25.zip
      You'll get three .ROM files - ATARIBAS.ROM, ATARIOSB.ROM and ATARIXL.ROM.
      We cannot distribute them due to licensing and copyright issues. Sorry.

1. Q: I want Windows version of Atari800 with Windows GUI.
   A: Try Atari800Win PLus: http://atariarea.histeria.pl/PLus/index_us.htm

2. Q: If I use keyboard as the emulated joystick in the DOS version
      it often stops some games (e.g. Bruce Lee). What should I do?
   A: Press F7 to switch the keyboard into joy-only mode. Or better,
      use a real joystick (either PC or the old CX-40 Atari one).

3. Q: How about keyboard joysticks in the SDL version?
   A: Two keyboard joysticks are defined in the config file (once it is saved
      from the UI). See SDL_JOY_xxx options. Their values are from
      http://www.libsdl.org/cgi/cvsweb.cgi/SDL12/include/SDL_keysym.h file.
      The joysticks can be enabled/disabled at runtime in the UI.
      Selected joysticks' state is saved to config file.
      Runtime configuration of keyboard joysticks mapping is not yet ready.

4. Q: Sound problems in xxx
   A: We know about problems with volume-only sound (digitized sound effects)
      and we plan on fixing them. You can try disabling the new HIFI Pokey
      emulation (in the UI go to Sound Settings and disable the HIFI there).

      I also experienced sound problems in SDL on GNOME Linux with ESD
      that were fixed by removing the libsdl1.2debian-esd library replacing
      it with libsdl1.2debian-alsa library (this is applicable only if you
      are using ALSA (http://alsa-project.org/) and GNOME with ESD, of course.
