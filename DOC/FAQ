Frequently asked questions (with answers)
-----------------------------------------

0. Q: Where to get ROM files for the emulator?
   A: Download the xf25.zip from http://prdownloads.sf.net/atari800/xf25.zip
      You'll get three .ROM files - ATARIBAS.ROM, ATARIOSB.ROM and ATARIXL.ROM.
      We cannot distribute them due to licensing and copyright issues. Sorry.
      In Atari800 UI there is an option to locate these ROM images.

1. Q: I want Windows version of Atari800 with Windows GUI.
   A: Try Atari800Win PLus: http://atariarea.histeria.pl/PLus/index_us.htm

2. Q: If I use keyboard as the emulated joystick in the DOS version
      it often stops some games (e.g. Bruce Lee). What should I do?
   A: Press F7 to switch the keyboard into joy-only mode. Or better,
      use a real joystick (either PC or the old CX-40 Atari one).

3. Q: How about keyboard joysticks in the SDL version?
   A: Two keyboard joysticks are defined in the config file (once it is saved
      from the UI). See SDL_JOY_xxx options. Their values are from
      http://www.libsdl.org/cgi/cvsweb.cgi/SDL12/include/SDL_keysym.h file.
      The joysticks can be enabled/disabled at runtime in the UI.
      Selected joysticks' state is saved to config file.
      Runtime configuration of keyboard joysticks mapping is not yet ready.

4. Q: Sound problems in xxx
   A: We know about problems with volume-only sound (digitized sound effects).
      See the BUGS file. You can try disabling the new HIFI Pokey
      emulation (in the UI go to Sound Settings and disable the HIFI there).

      I also experienced sound problems in SDL on my Debian GNU/Linux with ESD
      (a sound daemon coming with GNOME) that were fixed by installing
      the libsdl1.2debian-alsa package (that is compiled to output sound 
      directly to ALSA instead of going through the ESD (this is applicable
      only if you are using ALSA (http://alsa-project.org/) and have ESD
      running, of course).
