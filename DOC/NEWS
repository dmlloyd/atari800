Version 1.2.3 (2002/07/08)

* 16 kB RAM machines (Atari 400/600XL) emulated

* LPTjoy support added to the SDL port

* SDL port is generally much improved. To get list of SDL specific options
  start the SDL version of Atari800 with -help.

* casette image loading accessible from UI

* -palette option (for loading an alternate ACT color palette file) fixed.

* channel 1 in stereo mode fixed

* antic: NMIST bit 5 fixed (is always zero)

* input: second button in 5200 joystick generates "Break key" IRQ
  (you can now jump in "Moon Patrol" - use Shift)

* monitor: "DLIST" now accepts address as an argument

* antic: Dirty update scheme that allows slower machines to run Atari800
         at full speed now! See DOC/HOWTO-DIRTYRECT for more information.

* pokey: allow high-speed disk i/o (Alpha-Load works, thanks to Paul Irvine)


Version 1.2.2 (2001/12/31)

* Falcon .s files had to be renamed to .asm, otherwise the vga
  port could not be built.


Version 1.2.1 (2001/12/31)

* serious memory overflow bug fixed (caused crashing of X11 port
  and probably also other unexpected bugs or problems)

* joysticks in SDL port fixed and improved.

* RPM's .spec file fixed.


Version 1.2.1pre0 (2001/12/17)

* Falcon port configurable and buildable again

* SDL support for 32-bit display, screen width switching (LALT+g)

* documentation updated (still can be much improved :)

* util/ folder contains new sethdr and act2html utilities

* configure process is non-interactive (doesn't ask any questions)

* RPM .spec file for easy building of Atari800 from source .tar.gz


Version 1.2.0 (2001/11/29)

* completely new SDL port (use ./configure --target=sdl) that should run
  on most/all platforms/OSes SDL supports (http://www.libsdl.org/)

* completely new WinCE port

*** New features:

* support for Express, Diamond, SpartaDOS X, XEGS, Action!, BASIC XL
  and other cartridge types (see cart.txt for complete list).
  The "-cart" option runs CART files and all types of raw images.
  "-rtime 0" disables emulation of R-Time 8.
  Thanks to:
  - Jindroush, who described most of the cartridge types
  - Nir Dary, for information on 8*8 KB D50x and OSS 'M091' cartridges

* mouse can emulate following devices
  (in parentheses the option that enables emulation):
  - paddles (-mouse pad)
  - Atari Touch Tablet (-mouse touch)
  - Koala Pad (-mouse koala)
  - Light Pen (-mouse pen)
  - Light Gun (-mouse gun)
  - Amiga mouse (-mouse amiga)
  - Atari ST mouse (-mouse st)
  - Atari Trak-Ball (-mouse trak)
  - joystick (-mouse joy)
  For Atari 5200 you can use "-mouse pad" (good for Gorf and Kaboom)
  or "-mouse joy" (good for Missile Command and Super Breakout).
  Use "-mouseport <1-4>" to select the Atari port.
  Use "-mousespeed <1-9>" to select speed (default is 3).

* cassette recorder emulation! (experimental)
  Currently only reading works and only with SIO patch.
  Supported are:
  - CAS files - the digital cassette image format by Ernest Schreurs.
    The format handles different lengths of blocks, gaps, non-standard blocks,
    baud rates and more. See http://home.planet.nl/~ernest/home.html
    for the excellent WAV2CAS converter, which includes detailed description
    of the format. Atari800 supports the format only partially at the moment.
  - raw files - any file can be attached, as if it has been written
    to the C: device (standard Atari OS format).
  No UI available yet. Attach a file with "-tape filename"
  or "-boottape filename" (emulator presses Start and Space to boot the tape).

* SIO, H: and P: patches are now independent and can be toggled at run-time

* the H: device no longer replaces C:.
  The H: device is now added to HATABS in RAM, and the escape codes
  are put in 0xd100-0xd1ff, so H: doesn't modify Atari OS at all.

* "-basic" and "-nobasic" work for Atari 800 (Atari BASIC is attached
  as a cartridge in Atari 800)

* devices: added open mode 9 (append) for H: device

* input: the illegal joystick positions (e.g. left+right) are not passed
  to the emulated Atari (good for "Mario Bros.")

* monitor:
  - "C 600 ABCD" does the same as "C 600 CD AB"
  - 1 KB boundary is respected by "DLIST"
  - "POKEY" command
  - "S" without parameters repeats last search

* ui: added Atari Settings (enable/disable BASIC, R-Time 8, SIO patch, H:, P:)

*** Compatibility improvements:

* antic,gtia: the background color can be changed inside a scanline.
  Currently implemented only for blank lines without PMG.
  Try the "Partyland" part of the "Bitter Reality" demo.

* antic: corrected timing of DLISTL/H ("Spelunker" works)

* binload: 0x31 stored at 0x300 ("Studio Dream" loads now)

* cpu: Read-Modify-Write (RMW) instructions (ASL, INC, etc.) store
  the unmodified value of $D01A before they store the modified value.
  Now you can see the white dots made with INC $D01A.

* cpu: on reset, the I flag is set (now reset works if stuck in interrupts)

* devices: replaced "dGetByte(0x2e)" with "regX" in H: handler routines
  (fixes problems with Atari BASIC's GET/PUT/INPUT/PRINT)

* pia: & 0x3f on read PACTL and PBCTL

* pokey: potentiometers emulation improved: POTGO and ALLPOT registers
  and bit 2 of SKCTLS implemented, "Tree Surgeon" no longer hangs

* pokey: true RANDOM emulation (both 9- and 17-bit poly) !
  Not using rand() anymore. Try the "Bank Bang!" game.

* pokey: fixed STIMER (speech in "Mirax Force" is better, but still
  not perfect)

* pokey: a few fixes for stereo detection routines (helps "Sheol",
  "Total Daze", "Crockett's Theme"...)

* pokey: fixed SERIN ("Timeless Announcement" loads now)

* pokeysnd: added exact poly9_lookup and poly17_lookup, removed bit17
  (which was initialised with rand()) saving ca. 100 KB of memory.
  Do you hear any difference?

* sio: made double density ATR images compatible with SIO2PC

*** Bug fixes:

* cpu: fixed wrong extern

* devices: fixed Device_isvalid (problems with trailing 0x9b)

* rtime: added "byte &= 0x0f" to prevent out of bounds accesses
  to regset[]

* sio: corrected and added checks if drive number is in range 1-8

* sio: Format Disk rewritten. Now it can resize both ATR and XFD images.
  The ATR header is being updated. Double density format works.

*** Optimizations:

* antic: optimized ANTIC_Load and character modes

* atari_vga: no unnecessary Atari_DisplayScreen() calls if "-refresh" is used

* cpu: slight optimization of ROL and ROR

* gtia: optimized players in new_pm_scanline

*** Clean-ups in sources (for programmers):

* created cartridge.[ch] and rtime.[ch], removed supercart.[ch]

* created input.[ch] to handle keyboard, joysticks and mouse

* removed enable_rom_patches, added enable_h_patch and enable_p_patch.
  Original OS is saved in atari_os. Removed SetSIOEsc() and RestoreSIO().
  After changing enable_*_patch call Atari800_UpdatePatches().

* replaced following variables: machine, mach_xlxe, Ram256, os,
  default_system and enable_c000_ram with only two: machine_type and ram_size
  (ram_size is in kilobytes, and there're #define's for 320 Rambo/Compy).
  There are no more Initialise_Atari... routines. Instead, set machine_type
  and ram_size and call Atari800_InitialiseMachine().

* moved main() to platform-dependent code,
  created Atari800_Initialise and Atari800_Frame

* removed i386 asm tricks

* diskled: rewritten to be cleaner and more flexible

* pokey: SKSTAT variable renamed to SKCTLS to avoid confusions
  (it's the write-only, not the read-only Pokey register)

* pokeysnd: removed duplicates of Pokey constant definitions
  and AUDC/AUDF/AUDCTL variables, included pokey.h
