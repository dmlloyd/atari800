Who does build the binaries for Atari800 releases?
==================================================

The regular binaries for Linux (curses, SDL and X11) distributed
in RPM and Debian packages and available at Sourceforge.net for download
are built by me (Petr Stehlik).

Official Debian package is built by Martin Albert <ma@debian.org>

The following guys should build the binary for the other port/platform/OS:

Port (platform, OS):   Maintainer:

DOS                    James Wilkinson  <slor@comcast.net>

If there is a volunteer for any of the above listed ports or if there
is another port working that I didn't list then please contact me
