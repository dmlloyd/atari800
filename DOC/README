This is the version 1.2.0 of my Atari 800, 800XL, 130XE and 5200 emulator
for Unix, Amiga, MS-DOS and Atari TT/Falcon. My main objective
is to create a freely distributable portable emulator (i.e. with source
code available). It can be configured to run in the following ways :-

	1. BASIC mode
	2. CURSES Mode
	3. SVGALIB for Linux Systems
	4. X-Windows + Optional XVIEW or MOTIF User Interface
	5. CBM Amiga
 	6. MS-DOS
	7. Atari Falcon/TT and compatible machines
	8. MS Windows 9x
	9. SDL

The basic mode is only useful for running programs such as MAC65,
Atari Basic etc. I have had this version running on Linux,
SunOS 4.1.3, Solaris 2.4, Silicon Graphics, VAX/VMS, CBM Amiga
(Dice C and GNU C) and the HP-UX 9000/380.

The CURSES mode is similar to the basic mode, but it also enables full
screen editing capability. Some computer don't seem to support curses
fully - SunOS 4.1.3, VAX/VMS, LINUX (but ncurses is OK).

The SVGALIB version runs at a reasonable speed. The screen dimensions
are limited to 320x240.

The X-Windows version supports graphics and has an optional XVIEW
user interface. The Linux X Window version can be built with
joystick support (If joystick module is installed in the kernel).

The Amiga version supports graphics but currently lacks Paddle support.

The MS-DOS version supports 320x200, 320x240 and even 320x480 interlaced
graphics, sound (SoundBlaster compatible sound cards, 8bit),
keyboard, one joystick connected to game port and up to three additional
digital joysticks connected to parallel (printer) ports.

The Atari Falcon030/040 version supports 320x240 and 336x240 Falcon/TT
8-bit planes graphics modes, NOVA graphics cards, DMA sound and both
joysticks (old CX-40, Atari800 compatible - not the new paddle-like ones).

From version 0.7.0 all versions supporting bitmapped graphics have
a User Interface implemented on the emulators "screen". The User
Interface is enter by pressing F1 at any time. ESC is used to return
to the previous screen.

Features
--------

Note: Not all features are supported on all platforms.

o Atari 800, 800XL, 130XE and 5200 Games System.

  Note 1: During 130XE emulation Antic accesses the same memory bank
          which the main CPU is using.

  Note 2: 5200 emulation is incomplete, mainly controllers support!

o 48K/52K Atari 400/800 emulation (optional RAM between 0xc000 and 0xcfff)

o OSS Super Cartridges.

o Standard, Wide and Narrow Playfields.

o Display List Interrupts and Vertical Blank Interrupts.

o All Antic Display Modes.

o GTIA graphics support for all Antic modes including GTIA/Antic
  character modes.

o Player Missile Graphics with collision detection.

o Playfield and Player/Missile Priorities

o Access both ATR and XFD disk images.

o PIL mode - allows memory between 0x8000 and 0xbfff to be toggled
  between RAM and ROM.

o Horizontal and Vertical Fine Scrolling.

o Optionaly extended use of COLPF1 in Antic Modes 2, 3 and f. This
  allows the use of two different colours instead of one colour and
  two luminances.

o Printer Support.

o Sound Support on Unix using "/dev/dsp".

o Files can be stored directly on your host computer via the H: device.
  This device replaces the C: device.

o Hot Disk and Cartridge swapping.

o Joystick controller using numeric keypad.

o Real joystick support.

o Paddle controller using X-Windows mouse position.

o User Interface on all version supporting bitmapped graphics.
  i.e. X11, SVGALIB, MS-DOS, Amiga and Falcon/TT.
