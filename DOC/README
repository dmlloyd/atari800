This is the version 2.0.3 of the Atari 800, 800XL, 130XE and 5200 emulator
for Unix, Linux, Amiga, MS-DOS, Atari TT/Falcon, MS Windows, MS WinCE
and systems running the SDL library. Our main objective is to create
a freely distributable portable emulator (i.e. with source code available).
It can be configured to run in the following ways :-

	1. BASIC mode
	2. CURSES Mode
	3. SVGALIB for Linux Systems
	4. X Window + Optional XVIEW or MOTIF User Interface
	5. CBM Amiga
 	6. MS-DOS
	7. Atari Falcon/TT and compatible machines
	8. MS Windows 9x
	9. SDL
	10. WinCE

The basic mode is only useful for running programs such as MAC65,
Atari Basic etc. I have had this version running on Linux,
SunOS 4.1.3, Solaris 2.4, Silicon Graphics, VAX/VMS, CBM Amiga
(Dice C and GNU C), DOS/DJGPP and the HP-UX 9000/380.

The CURSES mode is similar to the basic mode, but it also enables full
screen editing capability. Some computer don't seem to support curses
fully - SunOS 4.1.3, VAX/VMS, LINUX (but ncurses is OK).

The SVGALIB version runs at a reasonable speed. The screen dimensions
are limited to 320x240.

The X Window version supports graphics and has an optional XVIEW
or MOTIF user interface. The Linux X Window version can be built with
joystick support (if joystick module is installed in the kernel).

The Amiga version supports graphics but currently lacks Paddle support.

The MS-DOS version supports 320x200, 320x240 and even 320x480 interlaced
graphics, sound (SoundBlaster compatible sound cards, 8bit),
keyboard, one joystick connected to game port and up to three additional
digital joysticks connected to parallel (printer) ports and mouse.

The Atari Falcon030/040 version supports 320x240 and 336x240 Falcon/TT
8-bit planes graphics modes, NOVA graphics cards, DMA sound and both
joysticks (old CX-40, Atari800 compatible - not the new paddle-like ones).

The SDL version should compile on Unix, Win32, BeOS, etc... It's optimized for
8, 16 and 32 color depth. Of course it will work fastest in 8bit. If you use it
in XFree86 - please set "Depth=8" in XF86Config to gain maximum speed.

From version 0.7.0 all versions supporting bitmapped graphics have
a User Interface implemented on the emulator's "screen". The User
Interface is enter by pressing F1 at any time. ESC is used to return
to the previous screen.
