I'm new to the list and I have a contibution for you.

atari_console is a new UI that aims to make atari800 act like a command
stream.

 - Command line feal
 - Scriptable atari800.
 - Get logs or listings from atari.
 - Use expect like scripts to run atari tasks.

Example:
   spawn atari800 -xl
   expect READY
   send "load \"d1:myprog.bas\""
   expect READY
   SEND list

Example: - script to start SAM and say things typed in:
    #!/usr/bin/expect -f
    spawn atari800 -xl sam.atr
    expect READY
    send "run \"d1:sayit.sam\"\n"
    expect "SPEAK FROM SAM OR RECITER"
    send "RECITER\n"
    interact

Also, I changes some of the Error prints in the code to use fprintf, so
you can redirect atari_console and still see error messages.
Also, I put sound support in atari_curses and atari_command, and renamed
the functions to more generic names ( The OS may not be Linux, and/or
the sound driver may not be Voxware/OSS).
