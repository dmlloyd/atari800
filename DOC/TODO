This is a list of things that need to be done
---------------------------------------------
o update documentation (README, USAGE, INSTALL) to cover all the
  new ports.

o make the new function Rotate_Disks in sio.c available from UI

o merge common parts of VGA, SVGALIB and AtariFalcon keyboard stuff
  into one source file named like atari_keyboard.c.

o rewrite joycfg to use curses so it would be usable on all platforms.

o update Amiga and X11 ports, find and name maintainer for each port.
