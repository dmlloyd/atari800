This is a list of things that need to be done
---------------------------------------------
o make the new function Rotate_Disks in sio.c available from UI

o merge common parts of VGA, SVGALIB and AtariFalcon keyboard stuff
  into one source file named like atari_keyboard.c.

o rewrite joycfg to use curses so it would be usable on all platforms.

o before the SVGAlib is removed move the special features to the SDL port
  (speedup, joystick, cursorblock, recongnized keys)

o update RPM spec file and debian rules for new configure options

o if midlevel keyboard abstract layer can't find volunteers then perhaps
  configurable keyboard layout (in text file?) would do?

o find out why atari_sdl doesn't use common Atari_Frame/Input code and
  possibly fix it.

o remove SVGAlib as soon as the SDL target is in better shape than SVGAlib
  ever was.

o further clean up in the directory structure - port specific files should
  be hidden in their subfolders (falcon, amiga, ..)

o try to find out a common interface for setting host sound parameters from
  the command line - freq (11050 - 44100), bits (8/16) and then remove 
  the port specific command line parsing and make use of RtConfig file.
