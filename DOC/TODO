This is a list of things that need to be done
---------------------------------------------
o sound recording: make use of new sndsave.[ch] module (replace the
  code in X11)

o make the new function Rotate_Disks in sio.c available from UI

o allow user to choose whether open a disk image read-only or not
  (third parameter in SIO_Mount)

o merge common parts of VGA, SVGALIB and AtariFalcon keyboard stuff
  into one source file named like atari_keyboard.c.

o similarly create common sound.[ch] routines

o finally merge sound_dos and dossound (the goal is to remove dossound)

o rewrite joycfg to use curses so it will be usable on all platforms.

o simplify and correct synchronization code in main emulator loop - some
  people still complain that the emulator is slower than the original Atari.

o update the m68k assembler version of cpu.c

o clean up the source and start using GNU autoconfig stuff
