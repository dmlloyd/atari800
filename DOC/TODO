This is a list of things that need to be done
---------------------------------------------
o put all possible configuration to RT-CONFIG. Reduce the scary number
  of command line parameters. Teach users (and also contributors/programmers)
  about RT-CONFIG and the Atari800 config file.

o extend the configuration options in UI to cover all RT-CONFIG options.

o add "Save Config" to UI.

o merge common parts of VGA, SVGALIB and AtariFalcon keyboard stuff
  into one source file named like atari_keyboard.c.

o include joycfg in Atari800 itself

o before the SVGAlib is removed move the special features to the SDL port
  (speedup, joystick, cursorblock, recongnized keys)

o if midlevel keyboard abstract layer can't find volunteers then perhaps
  configurable keyboard layout (in text file?) would do?

o find out why atari_sdl doesn't use common Atari_Frame/Input code and
  possibly fix it.

o remove SVGAlib as soon as the SDL target is in better shape than SVGAlib
  ever was.

o further clean up in the directory structure - port specific files should
  be hidden in their subfolders (falcon, amiga, ..)

o try to find out a common interface for setting host sound parameters from
  the command line - freq (11050 - 44100), bits (8/16) and then remove 
  the port specific command line parsing and make use of RtConfig file.

o R: device configuration: TCP port should be configurable (currently
  hardwired to 9000). Put it to RT-CONFIG struct. Also the switch
  between real serial port and TCP port should be put there. Something
  along the following lines:
  R_SERIAL = 1
  R_SERPORT = /dev/ttyS0
  R_NETPORT = 9000
