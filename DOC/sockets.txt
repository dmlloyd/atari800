---- about the R: device in Atari800 emulator ----

From: Chris Martin <cmartin@ti.com>

I have some code that I have integrated into my personal
download of atari800 v1.3.0 for allowing talking to the
Atari800 emulator via R: and network sockets.  I have taken
some code released by Tom Hunt and made some bug fixes and a
few minor updates. 

I have tested this both under Solaris and Linux.  I have
plans to update the code to allow connections to the host
machine serial ports for talking to a real Modem as well.

I have tested this with Bobterm and Ice-T.  If you need the ATR files for
these programs, let me know.

Once in Bobterm or Ice-T you can type 'ATDI localhost 23', to telnet.

I would like to add options for allowing to compile this or not, and
command line args for the connect string and the port number (it accepts
connections on port 9000 now for in coming calls...)

Best regards,
Chris
