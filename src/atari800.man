Paddles, Atari touch tablet, Koala pad, light pen, light gun,
ST/Amiga mouse, Atari trak-ball, joystick and Atari 5200 analog
controller are emulated using mouse on ports that support it.
See the options above for how to enable mouse.

.SS Curses

F10 (Save screenshot) does not work in the default CURSES_BASIC build.
Shift+F5 and Shift+F10 don't work at all.
Avoid Ctrl + C, H, J, M, Q, S and Z. The remaining control characters
can be typed. Control characters are displayed on the screen
with the associated upper case character in bold.

Controllers not supported in this version.

(try out JOYCFG.EXE).

To redefine keys for joystick emulation you must modify SDL_TRIG_* and
SDL_JOY_* in atari_sdl.c, then recompile Atari800. In source you can also turn
off sound or change defaults (FULLSCREEN, BW, SWAP_JOYSTICKS, WIDTH_MODE).

On Linux, standard joysticks are supported.
