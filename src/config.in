#ifndef __CONFIG__
#define __CONFIG__

/* Format:
 ?[!][(premise)]def_name	[text for prompting]

   This line from .in file is in .h file replaced with '#define def_name' if
answer for this config option is yes, or with '' if answer is no.
   If char '!' is after '?', then described function is inverted.
   Field 'premise' is comma separated list of def_names. If it's present,
then user is prompted only if all def_names in premise are defined.
If user is not prompted, the default answer is equal to answer 'No'.
Def_names in premise field may start with '!' which invert its meaning.
   If text field is not present, then def_name is defined, or undefined
by configure's build-in test.
