I slapped this together to put the checksum data into the cartridge header.
But, I thought others may want it, too.  I suppose it could also be written
to create a new file with the header if the source file doesn't already have
a 16 byte chunk of garbage at the beginning.  As I rewrite the entire
header, simply append a raw ROM image to a 16 byte file and run this script.
If a valid header is already there, then you can skip the cartridge type
menu.  I almost wrote this is C, but then I figured it'd be easier to write
a single script that should be usable on almost all platforms.  It's a
little bloated, I'm sure, but it's my first perl script ever.

I was asked to make a couple changes/upgrades to my script.  I had already
planned to do one of them, but the other suggestions sounded good, too.
Thank Piotr for suggestions.  Anyway, here's the revised script.  I changed
the name, as the script will now add the header if it's missing (no choice
on that) and then present you with only the options that match the image
size.  It will let you know if the checksum that is in the header is valid
(obviously won't be if I just created the header, but it will write a valid
checksum after you select a cartridge type).  It will also show the current
selected type.  An '@' will show if the header is blank.
